With the above application you can create the database or enable migrations if the database already
exists with the following command:

$ python manage.py db init
This will add a migrations folder to your application. The contents of this folder need to be added
to version control along with your other source files.

You can then generate an initial migration:

$ python manage.py db migrate
The migration script needs to be reviewed and edited, as Alembic currently does not detect every
change you make to your models. In particular, Alembic is currently unable to detect indexes. Once
finalized, the migration script also needs to be added to version control.

Then you can apply the migration to the database:

$ python manage.py db upgrade
Then each time the database models change repeat the migrate and upgrade commands.

To sync the database in another system just refresh the migrations folder from source control and
run the upgrade command.

To see all the commands that are available run this command:

$ python manage.py db --help
